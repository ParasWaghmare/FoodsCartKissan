SPACING</br>
For normal sown crop a spacing of 20 - 22.5 cm between rows is recommended. When sowing is delayed a closer spacing of 15-18 cm should be adopted.</br></br>

SOWING DEPTH</br>
The sowing depth should be 4-5 cm.</br></br>

METHOD OF SOWING</br>
1. Seed drill</br>
2. Broadcasting method</br>
3. Zero tillage drill</br>
4. Rotavator</br></b></p>
