<p><font size = "5"><b>General Info :</b></font></p>
<p><b>Rice is the most important food crop of India covering about one-fourth of the total cropped area</br>
 and providing food to about half of the Indian population. Punjab has made tremendous progress in rice</br>
 productivity and production during the past 45 years. Due to use of high yielding varieties and </br>
 new technology Punjab has given the title of "Rice Bowl of India".</b></p></br>
<p><font size = "5"><b>SOIL :</b></font></p>
<p><b>It can be grown on a variety of soils with low permeability and pH varying from 5.0 to 9.5.</br>
 Sandy loam to loamy sand to silty loam to clay loams, silty to clayey loam soils with low permeability, </br>
free of water logging and sodicity are considered best for paddy cultivation.</b></p></br>
<p><font size = "5"><b>POPULAR VARIETIES WITH THEIR YIELD :</b></font></p>
<p><b>

	Pusa Punjab Basmati 1509:</br> Early maturing variety i.e ready to harvest in 120 days. It is susceptible to bacterial blight. </br>
	Its grains extra long, slender and possess excellent cooking quality. It is suitable for multiple cropping pattern. It gives average yield of 15.7 qtl/acre.</b></p></br></br>

<p><font size = "5"><b>LAND PREPARATION :</b></font></p>
<p><b>
		After harvesting of wheat grow dhaincha (seed rate 20 kg/acre) or sunhemp @ 20 kg/acre or cowpea @ 12 kg/acre up to first week of May. </br>
		When crop is of 6-8 week old, bury them into the soil one day before transplanting of paddy. It will save 25 kg of N per acre.</br>
		Use laser land leveler for land levelling. After then puddle soil and to obtained fine well levelled puddle field to reduce water loss</br>
		through percolation.</b></p></br>
<p><font size = "5"><b>SEED :</b></font></p>
<p><b>Seed Rate:</b></br>
For direct sowing or broad casting use seed rate of 7-8kg/acre and for dibbling use seed rate of 7-9 kg/acre.</br>
For wet bed and dry bed paddy nursery, 10-12 kg seeds for 500 square metre nursery area is sufficient for transplanting </br>
one acre of main field. Where as in modified dapog method use seed rate of 10-15 kg for 100m2 nursery area for transplanting one acre land.</p></br>

<p><b>Seed treatment:</b></br>
Before sowing, soak them in 10 Ltr water containing, Carbendazim@20gm+ Streptocycline@1gm for 8 to 10 hour before sowing. </br>
After then dry seeds in shade. And then use for sowing.Also you can use below mention fungicides to protect crop from root</br>
 rot disease. Use chemical fungicides first then treat seed with Trichoderma. </p></br>

<p><font size = "5"><b>SOWING :</b></font></p>
<p><b>
<i>Time of sowing: </i></br>
Nursery Preparation: 15th to 30th May is the optimum time for nursery preparation.</br>

<i>Spacing: </i></br>

For normal sown crop a spacing of 20 - 22.5 cm between rows is recommended. When sowing is delayed a closer spacing of 15-18 cm should be adopted.</br>

<i>Method of sowing: </i></br>
Broadcasting method</br>

<i>Sowing depth: </i></br>
The seedlings should be transplanted at 2 to 3 cm depth. Shallow planting gives better yields. </b></p></br>

<p>sBefore sowing, soak them in 10 Ltr water containing, Carbendazim@20gm+ Streptocycline@1gm for 8 to 10 hour before sowing.</br>
	After then dry seeds in shade. And then use for sowing.</p></br></br>

<i>Nursery Preparation: </i></br>
15th to 30th May is the optimum time for nursery preparation.</br></br>
 
<i>Wet bed nursery: </i></br>
It is done in region having adequate water availability. Nursery area is about 1/10 of the area to be transplanted.</br>
 Broadcast Pre-germinated seeds on puddled and levelled soil. Keep the beds moist for the first few days.</br>
 Do not flood the beds. When the seedlings are about 2 cm high, keep the beds submerged in a shallow layer of water.</br>
 Apply dose of 26 kg/acre Urea about a fortnight after sowing. For transplantation use seedlings of 15-21 days or</br>
 when seedlings are 25-30 cm long. Regularly irrigated the nursery.  </br></br>

<i>Dry Bed:</i></br>
 It is prepared in dry soil condition. Total seed bed area is about 1/10 of the area to be transplanted.</br>
 Make seed bed of convenient dimensions with the soil raised at height of 6-10 cm. Spread half burned rice husk on these beds for easy uprooting.</br>
 Irrigation should be done properly because less moisture can damage seedling. Incorporate basal fertilizer for proper nutrients.</br></br>

<i>Modified Mat nursery: </i></br>
This is the modified method of nursery making which require less space and less quantity of seeds.</br>
 It can be cultivated at any place having flat surface and assured water supply. The area needed is about 1% of the transplantable land.</br>
 Establishing seedlings in 4 cm layer of soil mix, arranged on a firm surface. Make 1 meter wide and 20-30 meter long plot </br>
and spread plastic sheet or banana leaves on it. Place a wooden frame with 4 cm deep and then fill the frame with soil mixture.</br>
 Sow pre-germinated seed in it and cover the seed with dry soil. Immediately sprinkle water on it. Irrigate frame as and when needed and keep it moist.</br>
 Seedlings are ready for transplanting within 11 to 14 days of sowing. Transport seedling mat to field and separate them and </br>
transplant 1-2 seedlings at 20x20 cm or 25x25 cm spacing.   </br></br>

<i>Depth of planting: </i></br>
The seedlings should be transplanted at 2 to 3 cm depth. Shallow planting gives better yields. </br></br>


<i><b>Method of Transplanting :</b></i></br></br>

1) Flat puddled transplanting: Transplant seedlings in line at 20x15 cm for normal and 15x15 cm for late transplanting.</br>
 Put 2 seedlings per hill and the seedlings should be transplanted upright and about 2-3 cm deep.</br></br>

2) Bed Transplanting: Transplant seedlings on middle of slopes of bed. These bed are prepared by wheat bed planter in heavy soil.</br>
 Before transplanting irrigate the furrows, then transplant seedlings by maintaining a plant to plant distance of 9 cm.</br></br>

3) Mechanical transplanting: For transplanting Mat type nursery, mechanical transplanter are used. It transplant seedlings at spacing of 30x12 cm.</br>

<p>
For paddy apply N:P:K@50:12:12 kg/acre in form of Urea @110 kg/acre, SSP@75 kg/acre and MOP@20 kg/acre.</br>
 Before fertilizer application, carried out soil test and apply fertilizer on the basis of soil test result. </br>
Apply P and K dose if soil test show deficiency of it. If DAP is to be used, apply Urea@100 kg/acre, DAP@27 kg/acre </br>
and MOP@20 kg/acre. Apply 1/3rd dose of Nitrogen and whole dose of P and K before last puddling.</br></br>

Apply second dose three week after transplanting and three weeks after 2nd dose, apply remaining dose of Nitrogen.</br>
 Use neem coated Urea as it will increased uptake of N. Apply Zinc sulphate heptahydrate@25 kg or zinc sulphate monohydrate@16 kg/acre </br>
at puddling to overcome zinc deficiency. Due to water scarcity, young leaves give yellow or yellow white appearance </br>
about three week after transplanting. Apply irrigation immediately also spray with ferrous sulphate@1 kg/100 ltr water per acre, </br>
two-three time with weekly intervals.</p>

<p><font size = "5"><b>WEED CONTROL :</b></font></p>
<p>Use Butachlor 50 EC @ 1200 ml/acre or Thiobencarb 50 EC @ 1200 ml or Pendimethalin 30 EC @ 1000 ml </br>
or Pretilachlor 50 EC @ 600 ml per acre as pre-emergence herbicides, 2 to 3 days after transplanting.</br>
Mix any one of these herbicides in 60 kg of sand per acre and broadcast uniformly in 4-5 cm deep standing water.</br>

For broadleaf weed control, apply Metsulfuron 20 WP @ 30 gm/acre in 150 Ltr water as post emergence, </br>
20-25 days after transplanting. Before spray, drained out the standing water from the field and apply irrigation one day after spray.</p>

<p><font size = "5"><b>IRRIGATION :</b></font></p>
<p>Keep field flooded up to two weeks after transplanting. When all water gets infiltrated two day after apply irrigation in field. </br>
Depth of standing water should not exceed 10 cm. While doing intercultural and weeding operation, drain out excess water from field and</br>
irrigate field after completion of this operations. Stop irrigation about a fortnight before maturity to facilitate easy harvesting.</p>
<p><font size = "5"><b>WEED CONTROL :</b></font></p>
<p>Reap the yield once the panicles are developing fully as well as the crops get changed significantly yellow.</br>
	The yield is generally harvested manually by sickles or by blend harvester. The harvested crops, tied up into compact bundles,</br>
 strike it against really hard surface to split the grains from straw, accompanied by winnowing.</p></br>
